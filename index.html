	<ol>
  <li>I was born in the Netherlands</li>
  <li>I moved to Singapore during elementary school</li>
  <li>Then I came to London for university, where I went to the School of Oriental and African Studies and the London School of Economics</li>
  <li>I got a scholarship to study Chinese in Beijing, which I did for a year</li>
  <li>And then I just stayed because I loved it, starting my worklife with roles in editing, social media management, and translation</li>
  <li>Finally after 7 years I came back to London to work in account management and customer success</li>
  <li>I love to travel: my favourite recent trip was to Madagascar where we saw humpback whales</li>
